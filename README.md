Experimental QoE Testbed and Results

Due to the ever increasing demand for the use of video adaptive streaming applications, it becomes essential to develop an objective model to predict the quality of user experience without human intervention. We proposed an experimentation framework through programmable network management for the development of Machine learning (ML) Training-Ready Data and MOS/QoE Prediction. The framework supports a range of universal quality metrics such as resolution, bit rate, and frame rate in a software defined network environment to determine a MOS (Mean Opinion Score) based on a dataset of previously trained media content and user opinion scores. Our proposed method is based on the generation of that data and we used current state-of-the-art ML classification methods to show the accuracy of the generated data and its predicted MOS. The paper describes the techniques used for the experiment on a QoE model to demonstrate how the experimentation framework can support ML-driven research for QoE modelling.
